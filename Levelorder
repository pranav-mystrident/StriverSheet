    //then create a level order function, which goes through each level and 
    //puts them in a queue, pop the elements off after that, then check whether they have any children or not, if left or right exist, put them in a queue, and themselves(root) into the vector of vectors

                THIS FOR LOOP IS A MAJOR BUG WHICH CAUSED THIS PROGRAM TO SHOW ERROR
                Suppose q initially has 1 node (root)
                You enter the for loop: i=0; i<1
                You push left and right children → queue size becomes 3
                Now i=1 < 3 → loop continues unexpectedly
                This mixes levels and breaks the level order logic.
